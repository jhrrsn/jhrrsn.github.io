####WALL BALL
This one was pretty quick too - it used a lot of the same code as Pong, which helped.

Again I had to add some failsafes against things like the ball bouncing endlessly horizontally between the sides of the stage, but generally it was all straightforward physics in Unity. The power-ups were fun, I had originally intended to add more but I got a little bored with Breakout! In the end there were two, a simple paddle extension and a more challenging (and probably not that well-explained!) slow-motion ball. I also really enjoyed making the ascending notes that play if you manage to hit multiple bricks in a single bounce.
