            <h4>Hello!</h4>
            <p>My name is Jack. I spend most of my day working for <a href="http://os.uk">Ordnance Survey</a>, making maps &amp; taking names. It's okay.</p>
            <p>This website, though, is mainly about a hobby of mine - game development! In the past I've designed digital &amp; tabletop games, though recently I've been focusing on the former. I want to get better at it, too, and make some kickass games for me &amp; my friends to play together.</p>
            <p>I'll post <a href="/projects">completed projects</a> on here, as well as progress posts (when I can summon the willpower). Peace!</p>
